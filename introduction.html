                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                <p>I'm an ordinary Asian dude, who was born in Australia. So I guess I'm Australian. The language I speak in  public and at home is English. The hobbies that I enjoy frequently are basketball, piano and playing games.</p>
                <p>My love for technology is indefinite as I see technology grow around me.  It astounds me on how much can be achieved in a couple of years. My first ever game I played on my dad's computer was 'PinBall Space Cadet'. If I could say what interests me to technology, it would be the hardware and software that allows modern society to communicate with one another.</p>

                <h3>WHAT DRIVES ME?</h3>
                <p>My main reason for partaking a career of Cyber Security is to prove to my friends, family and myself wrong, and that I can go through obstacles that has never been leapt before; that I can fail over and over again and still stand back up, and try again. Cyber  Security is also interesting as it is under encryption and security. I've always taken interests on how company and businesses protect their data, how they intentionally try to take down the system to find flaws within and fix it, and how everything works in general.</p>
