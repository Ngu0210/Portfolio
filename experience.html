                <h3>WHATS MY SKILLS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java (2016-2018) - This is my first and favourite type of programming. Back in my school days, I would spend countless/sleepless nights programming in excitement and frustration. But once you get something working, it's addicting.</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS (2014-Present) - Even though I've started learning html ages ago (on and off), I never fail to learn something new every single time. I find html also just as fun as Java, but not as satisfying.</li>
                    <li>Python (2019-2020) - At the start Python felt like something I wanted to avoid (don't know why), but once I started learning it, it turns out to be super fun, super simple and super easy to learn.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>WHAT DID I LEARN</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Database SQL (2019) - I've learnt this through High school and University, though it wasn't my favourite subject to learn from</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript (2016) - As I previously stated I've started learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript at high school and slowly upskilling as time progress</li>
                    <li>Java (2016) - Learnt this at highschool, its my favourite programming language so far</li> 
                    <li>Project Managing (2017) - Learnt this in high school, it's my favourite programming language so far</li> 
                    <li>Microbit (2019) -  Learnt this at university. I made a reaction timing game, where it times how fast you hit the button when the red light appears.</li> 
                    <li>Raspberry Pi (2017) - Learnt this at high school when my friend introduced me to his Raspberry Pi, it was an unbelievable thing I've ever seen</li>
