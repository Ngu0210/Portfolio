            <p>" Omg I got my first dog! Look how he's elegantly running through the grass. Sucks to those who has never had a puppy before. I finally decided a name for her ... 'Popeye the White dog' because it's a white dog. "</p>

            <p>You would not believe this story. I was walking around minding my own business until a squirrel attacked me. I was so shocked on how fast it moved, so I just booked it and ran the opposite direction. But anyways here's a picture of food.</p>

            <p>What an amazing trip! First of all, I have no idea how I got here. A little spontaneous moment later, and here I am. Northern Italy. This lake though, UNBELIEVABLE! That turquoise water, and beautiful scenery. A trip worth saving for.</p>
